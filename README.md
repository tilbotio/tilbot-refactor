# Tilbot: democratizing conversational agent development and research

This is a version of the Tilbot platform that uses SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS
+ DaisyUI. It is still under development and does not contain the
functionality of the initial version of Tilbot (built on jQuery) yet.

## Getting Started

Using docker:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Go to http://localhost:5173/login in your browser.

Use the suggested credentials for the admin user.

Create a new user. Log out, then log in using that new user.
Create a project. Use the link icon to go to that project.
